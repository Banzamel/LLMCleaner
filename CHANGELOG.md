# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-12)

First public release.

- Scan → plan → summary → confirmation flow; the default answer is *no*.
- Whitelist cleanup: temp files, Windows Update cache, crash dumps, CBS/DISM logs, browser caches
  (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox), developer caches, GPU shader caches, thumbnails, DNS, and optionally DISM and Docker.
- Leftovers of uninstalled software: orphaned program folders, Steam and Epic game leftovers, dead uninstall entries,
  orphaned registry keys with their subkeys, and large files in Downloads.
- Leftover folders and files go to the Recycle Bin; registry keys are backed up to `.reg` before deletion.
- Optional local AI assistant (Ollama), loaded on demand: `w` describes leftovers, `p` answers questions.
- Installer with a setup wizard (install location, desktop shortcut, optional Ollama and model setup, model folder)
  and a portable zip, both built by GitHub Actions.
